# HR Employee Attrition & Performance Analysis  
### Final Project – Data Analytics Course

---

## Project Overview

This project was completed as the **Final Project for the Data Analytics Course at Beat Educations**.

The objective of this analysis is to examine employee attrition patterns using the IBM HR Employee Attrition dataset (1,470 employees) and generate data-driven insights to support strategic HR decision-making.

The project demonstrates end-to-end analytical capabilities, from data preparation to business recommendations, using multiple analytical tools.

## Business Objective

Employee attrition impacts productivity, increases recruitment costs, and affects organizational stability.

This analysis aims to:

- Identify key drivers of employee attrition  
- Detect high-risk employee segments  
- Evaluate the impact of income, overtime, satisfaction, and tenure  
- Provide actionable retention strategies

## Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

### Attrition Label Standardization
- Yes → **Left**
- No → **Stayed**

### Created Business-Friendly Segments

**Age Groups**
- Young (18–25)  
- Adult (26–35)  
- Mid-Age (36–45)  
- Senior (46–60)  

**Income Levels**
- Low  
- Medium  
- High  
- Very High  

These transformations improved clarity and enhanced business interpretation in visualizations and dashboards.

## Dataset Summary

- Total Employees: 1,470  
- Employees Left: 237  
- Employees Stayed: 1,233  
- Overall Attrition Rate: 16.12%  

Although overall retention is strong, attrition is concentrated within specific roles and employee segments.

## Key Insights

### Attrition Is Concentrated in Specific Groups
Turnover is not evenly distributed across the organization; certain departments and roles experience higher attrition.

---

### Early-Career Employees Are Most at Risk
The highest attrition occurs within the first 1–2 years of employment, particularly among younger employees.

---

### Income Strongly Influences Retention
Lower-income employees show significantly higher attrition, while higher-income groups demonstrate strong stability.

---

### Overtime Increases Attrition Risk
Employees working overtime are more likely to leave, indicating potential burnout and workload imbalance.

---

### Job Satisfaction & Work-Life Balance Matter
Lower job satisfaction and poor work-life balance are strongly associated with higher attrition.

---

## High-Risk Employee Profile

Employees most likely to leave typically match the following profile:

> Early-career + Lower Income + Overtime Work + Low Satisfaction + Short Tenure

Targeted strategies for this group can significantly reduce turnover.

---

## Overall Business Recommendations

1. Strengthen onboarding and mentoring for early-career employees  
2. Review compensation structure for lower-income roles  
3. Reduce excessive overtime and improve workload balance  
4. Develop role-specific retention strategies for high-risk departments  
5. Enhance job satisfaction and promote work-life balance initiatives

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Excel  
- SQL  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Power BI  
- Tableau

## Conclusion

Employee attrition is driven by multiple interconnected factors rather than a single cause.  

By applying data-driven retention strategies focused on compensation, early engagement, workload management, and employee satisfaction, organizations can significantly improve workforce stability and reduce turnover.
